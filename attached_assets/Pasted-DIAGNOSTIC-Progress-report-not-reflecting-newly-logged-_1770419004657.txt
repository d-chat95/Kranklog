DIAGNOSTIC: Progress report not reflecting newly logged workouts — trace end-to-end

Context:
- New workouts and logs are being created successfully.
- Some logs appear in the database.
- Progress charts do not consistently reflect new data.
- Multiple dates exist (log date, workout creation date, UI completion date).
- There have been recent changes to chart grouping, anchor filtering, and invalidation.

Goal:
Identify EXACTLY why new logs are not appearing in Progress and which assumption is failing.

DO NOT fix anything yet. This is diagnosis only.

────────────────────────
A) Backend verification
────────────────────────

1) Log the raw database query used by GET /api/stats/e1rm:
   - Print:
     - movementFamily received
     - isAnchor received
     - number of logs returned
     - first 3 log rows: { id, date, weight, reps, rpe, workout_row_id }

2) Confirm:
   - Which date field is used downstream (logs.date vs others)
   - Whether logs are being filtered out due to:
     - is_anchor
     - movement_family mismatch
     - user_id mismatch

3) Explicitly answer:
   - Are logs from newly created workouts being returned by /api/stats/e1rm? (YES / NO)

────────────────────────
B) Frontend verification
────────────────────────

1) In client/src/pages/Progress.tsx, temporarily log:
   - Raw response from /api/stats/e1rm
   - chartData BEFORE any grouping / sorting
   - chartData AFTER grouping / sorting

2) Print:
   - length of each array
   - date values before and after transformation

3) Explicitly answer:
   - Are logs being lost in the frontend transformation step? (YES / NO)

────────────────────────
C) Cache / invalidation verification
────────────────────────

1) Confirm which React Query keys are used for:
   - useStatsE1rm
   - useCreateLog
2) Log when invalidation occurs after POST /api/logs
3) Explicitly answer:
   - Is Progress refetching after a new log is saved? (YES / NO)

────────────────────────
D) Date semantics check
────────────────────────

Explicitly list all dates involved:
- logs.date
- workouts.created_at
- workout_rows.created_at
- any derived or UI-only dates

Answer:
- Which date determines Progress placement?
- What happens if multiple logs exist on the same calendar day?
- Are logs collapsing into one point due to grouping logic?

────────────────────────
MANDATORY FINAL OUTPUT
────────────────────────

At the end, respond with:

1) Root cause (one sentence)
2) Where data is lost:
   - Backend filter
   - Frontend transform
   - Cache invalidation
   - Date grouping
3) One concrete example using real values:
   “Log X dated Y was (included/excluded) because Z”
4) Whether this is a BUG or an EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
5) What the *next fix* should be (one sentence only, no code)

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT apply fixes
- Do NOT refactor
- Do NOT add features
- Remove all temporary logs after reporting

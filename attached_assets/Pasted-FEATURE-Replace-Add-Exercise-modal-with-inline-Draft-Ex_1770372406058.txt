FEATURE: Replace “Add Exercise” modal with inline Draft Exercise Card + show Recommended Load on card

Context:
- Current UX uses a modal “ADD EXERCISE” form.
- The Recommended Load UI appears in that modal (based on /api/stats/suggestions), but disappears once the exercise row is created and shown as a normal card.
- User wants an inline creation flow: add button under last exercise -> blank draft card appears -> fill -> commit -> saved card appears.

Goals:
A) Inline draft exercise creation
1) On Workout Session page (/workouts/:id):
   - Remove the modal-based Add Exercise flow (or keep it but do not use it).
   - Add a button below the last exercise card: “+ Add Exercise”
2) When clicked:
   - Insert a new “Draft Exercise Card” at the bottom of the list (inline, not a modal).
   - The draft card contains the same fields currently in the modal:
     orderLabel, liftName, variant/details, sets, reps, intensityValue, intensityType (RPE), movementFamily, isAnchor, rest
   - Provide actions:
     - “Save Exercise” (commits via POST /api/workout-rows)
     - “Cancel” (removes the draft card without saving)

B) Recommended Load must appear in BOTH places:
1) In the Draft Exercise Card while editing:
   - When intensityType = RPE and reps + intensityValue are present,
     call existing suggestions logic and show:
     “Recommended Load: X lbs” + small breakdown line (based on anchor)
   - If no anchor data: show “No recommendation yet — log an anchor set.”

2) On the Saved Exercise Card (non-draft):
   - Display a small line under the prescription that shows either:
     - “Recommended Load (for this prescription): X lbs” (computed at render-time)
     - OR if no anchor data: “No recommendation yet”
   - This MUST persist visually (not only in the add form).

Constraints:
- Do not change backend endpoints or schema.
- Keep styling consistent with existing shadcn/tailwind.
- Ensure mobile layout works.

Acceptance:
- Add Exercise no longer requires a modal.
- Draft card appears inline and can be cancelled.
- Recommended Load is visible on draft card and saved card.
- Saving a new exercise updates the list immediately (no refresh) using correct react-query invalidation.

CHANGE REPORT REQUIRED at end:
- Files changed
- What was removed (modal)
- What was added (draft card)
- Where recommendation is now rendered (draft + saved card)

CHANGE: Add per-user ownership to Programs (and enforce it everywhere)

Current state:
Programs/Workouts/WorkoutRows are shared across all users (no owner field). Only logs are per-user.

Goal:
1) Add ownership to programs
2) Enforce ownership on all program/workout/row CRUD
3) Keep logs ownership enforcement as-is
4) Keep seed behavior working in dev but scoped to user

Constraints:
- Use Drizzle schema + npm run db:push
- No coach/admin features
- Do NOT change logs ownership rules

────────────────────────────────────────────
A) Schema change (Drizzle)
────────────────────────────────────────────
1) Add programs.ownerId (text)
   - IMPORTANT: Implement as nullable FIRST to avoid db:push failing on existing rows.
   - We'll enforce it logically in server code.
2) Update Drizzle schema/types and relations accordingly.

After this change, run db:push (already in repo) to apply schema.

────────────────────────────────────────────
B) Ownership enforcement rules
────────────────────────────────────────────
Programs:
- List/get/update/delete must be scoped by programs.owner_id = req.user.claims.sub
- Create must set owner_id server-side (never accept owner_id from client)

Workouts + WorkoutRows:
- For create/update/delete, verify the parent Program is owned by current user BEFORE allowing the mutation.
  Examples:
  - Creating a workout: confirm programId belongs to user (SELECT program where id=programId AND owner_id=userId)
  - Updating/deleting a workout: confirm workout belongs to a program owned by user (join workouts -> programs)
  - Creating workout_row: confirm workout belongs to a program owned by user (join workout_rows -> workouts -> programs)
  - Updating/deleting workout_row: same verification

Reads:
- /api/programs should show only the user’s programs
- /api/programs/:id should return 404 if not owned
- /api/workouts/:id should return 404 if the workout’s parent program is not owned

Logs:
- Keep existing logs ownership enforcement as-is.

────────────────────────────────────────────
C) Dev-safe backfill strategy (required for existing shared rows)
────────────────────────────────────────────
Because programs.owner_id may be NULL after db:push for existing rows, implement a dev-only lazy backfill:

- When an authenticated user requests GET /api/programs (or GET /api/programs/:id):
  - If any programs exist with owner_id IS NULL, assign them to the CURRENT USER (req.user.claims.sub) BUT ONLY when NODE_ENV=development.
  - This makes the app usable immediately without manual SQL.
  - After backfill, all ownership checks apply normally.

(Do NOT do this in production mode.)

────────────────────────────────────────────
D) Seed behavior
────────────────────────────────────────────
Keep seedDatabase working but scoped:
- Change seeding so it runs per-user (owned by that user), not globally.
- Do NOT seed at server boot with no user context.
- Implement ensureSeededForUser(userId):
  - In development only:
    - If the user has zero programs, seed the default program/workouts/rows for that user (with owner_id=userId).
- Call ensureSeededForUser(userId) inside GET /api/programs list handler AFTER auth.

────────────────────────────────────────────
E) Acceptance tests (must pass)
────────────────────────────────────────────
- Two different users do NOT see each other’s programs/workouts/rows
- Users can only edit/delete their own content
- Existing logging + progress still works

────────────────────────────────────────────
CHANGE REPORTING (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────
At end of response include:
A) Files changed
B) Schema changes (tables/columns)
C) Exact ownership checks added (where in code, which handlers/storage functions)
D) Backfill/seed behavior changes (dev-only)

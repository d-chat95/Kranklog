FEATURE: Add Recommended Load calculator to Workout Row form (first implementation)

Context:
- The app already calculates e1RM from anchor logs.
- The /api/stats/suggestions endpoint exists but currently returns limited/hard-coded values.
- There is currently NO load recommendation shown when creating/editing a workout row.

Goal:
Add a deterministic “Recommended Load” calculator based on the user’s logged anchor history.
This is a FIRST implementation — do not remove or rename existing UI yet.

────────────────────────
A) Backend (extend existing endpoint)
────────────────────────

1) Extend GET /api/stats/suggestions to ACCEPT additional query parameters:
   - movementFamily (required)
   - targetReps (required)
   - targetRpe (required)

2) If anchor history exists:
   - Compute e1RM from the latest anchor log.
   - Compute recommended load using:
     effectiveReps = reps + (10 - rpe)
     recommendedRaw = e1rm / (1 + 0.0333 * effectiveReps)
   - Round to nearest 5 lbs.

3) Response shape (additive — do not remove existing fields):
{
  recommendedWeight: number,
  recommendedRaw: number,
  e1rmUsed: number,
  basedOn: { date, weight, reps, rpe }
}

4) If no anchor history exists:
{
  recommendedWeight: null
}

Do NOT remove existing suggestion fields yet.

────────────────────────
B) Frontend (additive UI)
────────────────────────

1) In the Workout Row creation/edit form:
   - When movementFamily, reps, and target RPE are present:
     - Fetch /api/stats/suggestions with the new parameters.
   - Display a new inline block:
     “Recommended Load: {recommendedWeight} lbs”
     (optional muted text: “calc {recommendedRaw.toFixed(1)} lbs”)

2) If no recommendation is available:
   - Display: “No recommendation yet — log an anchor set.”

3) Do NOT remove or rename any existing “AI Suggestions” UI in this step.
   This is additive only.

────────────────────────
C) Acceptance
────────────────────────

- Entering reps + RPE shows a Recommended Load.
- Changing reps or RPE updates the recommendation live.
- Rounding is to 5 lbs.
- No existing UI is broken.

────────────────────────
CHANGE REPORT REQUIRED
────────────────────────

After implementing, respond with:
A) Files changed
B) What changed per file
C) Example calculation (input → output)
D) Confirmation that existing suggestion fields still exist

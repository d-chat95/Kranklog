TASK: Ownership E2E test plan + helper tooling (no new product features)

Goal:
Verify that Programs/Workouts/WorkoutRows are now isolated per-user (owner_id) and that two different users cannot see or mutate each other’s data.

Part 1 — Create 2 test users (no code changes required)
Provide exact step-by-step instructions to create two distinct authenticated users using the existing Replit OIDC auth:
- Use Browser A (normal) = User A
- Use Browser B (incognito or different browser) = User B
- Use two different identities (Google accounts or Google vs Apple) so the OIDC subject differs
Explain how to confirm the user identity in-app (e.g., /api/auth/user output) and in Supabase (users table).

Part 2 — Automated backend verification (add a dev-only test script)
Add a dev-only script that runs against the live server endpoints and asserts ownership boundaries.
Requirements:
- Add script at: scripts/ownership-e2e.ts
- Add npm script: "test:ownership": "tsx scripts/ownership-e2e.ts"
- The script should:
  1) Read two cookie strings or session tokens from environment variables:
     USER_A_COOKIE
     USER_B_COOKIE
     (these will be copied from the browser devtools)
  2) Call endpoints as User A to:
     - create a program "A-ONLY"
     - create a workout under it
     - create a workout_row under it
  3) Attempt the same reads/mutations as User B and assert:
     - GET /api/programs does not include "A-ONLY"
     - GET /api/programs/:id returns 404
     - GET /api/workouts/:id returns 404
     - PATCH/DELETE attempts return 404 or 403 (as implemented)
  4) Repeat in reverse (create "B-ONLY" as User B, ensure User A can’t see it)

Constraints:
- Do NOT add new API routes
- Do NOT change auth logic
- The script should use fetch with the Cookie header
- Print a clear PASS/FAIL report with the exact failing endpoint and response body if any

Part 3 — Minimal manual checklist (for me)
At the end, output a manual test checklist I can follow in 2 minutes (click-by-click), including:
- how to copy cookies
- what to expect in the UI
- what to check in Supabase tables (programs.owner_id, workouts linkage, rows linkage)

MANDATORY CHANGE REPORT:
A) Files changed
B) How to run the test (exact commands + env vars to set)
C) Expected output example for PASS
D) What to do if it FAILS (where to look first)
